          Tools the agent calls that execute in the user&apos;s browser rather
          than in the agent process. The handler runs client-side, so it can
          touch React state, browser APIs, and anything else only the frontend
          has access to — then returns a string the model reads as the tool
          result.

        The LlamaIndex workflow reads{" "}
        <code>RunAgentInput.tools</code> on every run and converts anything it
        does not already know into a pass-through tool: the model sees the
        schema, calls it, and the workflow stops so the browser can supply the
        result. That is why <code>sayHello</code> never appears in{" "}
        <code>backend/agents.py</code>, and why this repo registers the tool on
        the page that uses it rather than globally — if the route is not mounted,
        the tool is not offered, and the agent cannot call something with no
        handler.
