          The slot system customises CopilotKit&apos;s chat. This replaces it
          entirely: the bubbles, the input, the thinking indicator, and the
          layout are all hand-written. CopilotKit still supplies the message
          list, the streaming, and the run lifecycle — you just stop using its
          components to display them.
