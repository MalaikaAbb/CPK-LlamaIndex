# Doc drift changelog

What the CopilotKit docs changed under this repo, written by the sync on
`/doc-sync`. Only pages that actually moved are recorded — a sync that finds
everything unchanged writes nothing here at all.

Holds the 3 most recent dated entries. When a change lands on a fourth
date, the oldest entry is dropped. Entries are counted, not aged, so a gap of
weeks between changes does not expire anything.

+ In router mode, CopilotKit acts as a central hub, dynamically selecting and _routing_ requests between different agents or actions based on the user's input. This mode can be good for chat-first experiences where an LLM chatbot is the entry point for a range of interactions, which can stay in the chat UI or expand to include native React UI widgets.
